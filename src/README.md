# To-Do List

## Phase One

* In Phase 1, we’re going to perform some refactoring of a To-Do application built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

## Phase Two

* In Phase 2, we’re going to extend the functionality of our application by allowing the user to make some decisions on how they would like the application to function. Specifically, we’ll let them make changes to 2 settings.
